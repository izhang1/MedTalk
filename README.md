MedTalk is a paitent counseling app that can be used by any medical professional as well as pateitns. 

Our app Med Talk will streamline patient counseling at the point-of-care (POC) for healthcare professionals and provide a quick resource for patients who are interested in succinct information on how to take their prescription. Point-of-care is bolded because thatâ€™s the primary advantage of our product being a mobile app versus a web app. Here are other ways it can be used at POC:

- Nurses will use Med Talk to verify if their nursing home patient should take their meds with food

- Physicians can answer drug administration questions at their clinic/office

- Hospitalist/nurses/pharmacist can answer drug admin questions at discharge of patient from a hospital
People who care for an elderly family member with a lot of prescriptions can better educate them

- Individuals who are curious about their prescription(s) can learn the best time to take their meds
